This folder contains housebuilding data in new towns between 1950-1993, taken from annual housebuilding reports also released on this GitHub page.

Data relates only to housebuilding happening within the boundaries of the particular new town. Summaries on building by new towns in local authorities (after 1974) and counties (before 1973) are provided. This is only building within new towns within those larger geographies, not total building within those geographies. Users can combine this data with building at authority and county-level, also published on this GitHub repository, if they want to work out the contribution of new town building to total building within any given geography.

The workbook released provides basic summaries, breaking new towns into three 'waves', and looking at their respective contributions to total English housebuilding in the given year.
