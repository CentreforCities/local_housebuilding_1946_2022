This release contains annual housebuilding reports for England, 1946, 1950, 1951, 1953-2000, digitised from scans of reports taken from the LSE library. You can access these scans here:

To best understand the data in these files, we advise you to read the notes at the beginning of the original documents.

Note:

- Extensive data-checking was undertaken to ensure that numbers match those in the scans as far as possible. We cannot guarantee that they match exactly as checking every number against the scans would be impossible.
- Where there were obvious errors in the original documents, we changed these in the digitised versions using best estimates and interpolation.
- The housebuilding reports report cumulative housebuilding totals from April 1945 until 1966. After 1966, they switch to reporting building annually.
- From 1996 onward, building numbers are reported by financial year, rather than calendar year.
- Some values refer to only the first 9 months of the given year and this may not be noted in the digitised version of the scan. These are adjusted for when we join the datasets together using R. Full notes (usually given by asterisks) can be found in the original scans.
- There are other minor idiosyncracies between years (for example in the way private housebuilding within new towns is reported) which may not be noted in these files. Please refer to the original scans and/or read the R scripts for more information.
- Years 1947-1949 and 1952 are available from the LSE library, but we have not digitised these. Because totals are reported cumulatively, 1950, and 1953 years are taken to capture building in the preceding years, and numbers built in each year are estimated by interpolation, adjusted according to national building rates in each year.
