This folder contains two novel geopackages created for this project. 

The pre-1974 local authority geopackage is based on 1971 local authority boundaries. All housebuilding data pre-1974 is labelled with local authority names to match this geography. 
Where local authorities changed boundaries in complex ways (e.g. not a straightforward merger of two local authorities), the 1971 local authority boundaries are merged to capture all previous authorities, as far as possible. 
It is not possible to capture all pre-1971 boundary changes by merging 1971 LAs in all cases (save for aggregating up to an unusably large geography). Where necessary, idiosycracies were accepted and best judgement was exercised on the bases of settlement locations. 

The 1981 counties geopackage is based on the 1981 county boundaries, with London counties merged to current Greater London boundaries. County-level data in this repository match to these geographies as far as possible.
