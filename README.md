# local_housebuilding_1946_2022
Information about local authority housebuilding data 1946-2022, digitised and compiled in 2024 by Centre for Cities.   

## Description 
This repository describes the data Centre for Cities can make available following data work carried out for the 2024 Restarting Housebuilding series: 
https://www.centreforcities.org/housing/ 

 Data that can be provided is as follows:
- 'raw' digitised annual housebuilding reports, which provide private and public housebuilding totals at local authority level from 1946-2000. Public housebuilding data can be separated into local authority and housing associations after 1962. 

- R scripts used to knit these annual reports together, and combine them with other datasets to produce stock estimates and continuous datasets to the present-day. 

- Output workbooks - the products of the R scripts, useful for those wanting to quickly get into the data.

These contain total, private, public, local authority, housing association annual housebuilding totals, as well as stock estimates and population 1946-2022. The data is available at local authority district level (separate geographies pre- and post-1974), 1981 counties, and UK totals. 

A separate workbook containing data on housebuilding, public and private, by new town development corporations between 1950 and 1992 is also available. 

## How we got this data 
This data is mostly the product of a digitisation project led by the Centre for Cities in 2024. 

The London School of Economics Digital Library provided us with scans of housebuilding reports from 1946 through to 2000. They have now been uploaded to the LSE Online library here:

We digitised this data using a combination of OCR and manual data entry and checking. The digitised data is now free of any noticeable errors. Where there were obvious errors in the source data, this was corrected as best made sense given contextual data. Small errors may have slipped through the checking process, so digitised and scanned data may not 100% match. 

We have compiled this data into useable workbooks, and attached it to publicly available data on housebuilding, housing stock and population so that the data runs up to the present day.   

## Get access to this data 
The Centre for Cities wants to make the data available to others to use as easily as possible. We hope to make the data publicly available on GitHub in 2025.
